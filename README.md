# Grade 2 Project

### Introduction

Now the information age is developing rapidly, but people who go to work are very crowded on their way to work. The website for hitchhiking is a website that allows commuters who squeeze buses and subways to travel comfortably, save time, effort and money. It can also reduce the pressure of public transportation and save energy and environmental protection. The website not only includes car owner routes and passenger routes, but also provides car-sharing needs for car owners, but also provides a more worry-free way for commuters to carpool to and from work, saving money, time and comfort. Love carpool, love life, love carpool life.
